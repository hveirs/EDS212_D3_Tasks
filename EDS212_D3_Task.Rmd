## Creating Vectors
Vectors must have the same class, such as "chr" (character), "num" (numeric), "float" (floating)
Can check class using "class()" function

```{r}
marmots <- c("blue", "green", 4, "yellow")

#Check the class of our vector
class(marmots)
```

```{r}
pika <- c(12.4, 6.8, 8.6, 7.4, 5.3)

class(pika)

# Do scalar multiplication on the pika vector
pika_scalar <- 5.2 * pika
```

Vector operations

Dot product is done using %*% between the vectors in the order to want the dot product to be.

```{r}
bananas <- c(1, 2, 3)
apples <- c(6, 7, 8)

bananas + apples
bananas - apples

# Dot product of vectors is "%*%"
bananas %*% apples
```
